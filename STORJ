### **Global Tier (multi‑region network)**

* **Storage**: \$0.004 / GiB‑month (≈ \$4/TB/month)
* **Egress (download)**: \$0.007 / GiB (≈ \$7/TB), unlimited, no tiered overage fees
* **Segment Fee**: \$0.0000088 per segment per month (\~\$0.088 per 10,000 segments) ([storj.io][1])

### **Select (US‑only SOC 2 certified regions)**

* **Storage**: \$0.008 / GiB‑month (≈ \$8/TB/month)
* **Egress**: \$0.01 / GiB (≈ \$10/TB)

## 🔢 Pricing Mechanics Explained

### Storage

Charged by actual storage used at \$0.004/GiB‑month. No replication fees or hidden costs, unlike traditional cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, or GCP ([storj.io][1], [storj.io][2]).

### Egress

Downloads are billed per GB at \$0.007. Billing is based on bytes transferred from distributed nodes—not just what your application receives. For example, downloading a 1 TB file might consume \~1.3 TB bandwidth due to redundancy and long-tail elimination strategies and would cost \~\$9.10 at that rate ([Storj Docs][3]).

### Segment Fees

Storj splits data into 64 MB “segments.” Each segment incurs a monthly fee of \$0.0000088. Small files—which generate many segments—can lead to significant overhead. Example: storing 100,000 one‑GB files (1,600,000 segments) over half a month costs about \$7 in segment fees ([Storj Docs][3]).

---

## 📌 Billing & Fees

* **Minimum monthly charge**: \$5 fee if total usage (storage + bandwidth + segment fees) is under \$5—unless paying with STORJ token or via reseller, where the minimum may be waived ([storj.io][1]).
* **Free trial**: 25 GB storage + 25 GB egress for 30 days. Free if usage remains within limits ([storj-com.webflow.io][4]).

---

## ⚖️ Pros & Cons & Use Case Context

### Pros ✅

* Extremely low cost: \~80% savings compared to legacy providers like AWS, Backblaze, or Wasabi ([storj.io][5]).
* Global distribution built-in at no extra cost.
* Strong durability (11 nines) and 99.95% availability with end‑to‑end encryption ([storj.io][5], [storj-com.webflow.io][4]).
* No hidden API or multipart fees.

### Cons ⚠️

* **Small file scenarios**: High segment fees if storing lots of tiny files can make costs climb. Packing small files into larger bundles (using 64 MB segments) is recommended ([storj.io][1], [Reddit][6]).
* **Deletion reliability**: Some users report that deleting large buckets via the web UI may silently fail, leading to unexpected charges if not verified manually ([Reddit][7]).

## 🧮 Sample Use-case Cost Estimates

### Example 1: Cold Backup

* 1 TB stored → \$4/month
* Assume 0.1 TB egress → \$0.70
* Segment fee: if storing large files (1 TB as \~16,000 segments) → \~\$0.14
* Likely **≥ \$5**, so billed as usage (no minimum fee).

### Example 2: Many small files (e.g. email/archives)

* 1 TB comprised of many 1 MB files (\~1,048,576 segments)
* Segment fee: \~1,048,576 × \$0.0000088 ≈ \$9.23/month
* Total cost increases meaningfully even with little egress.

---

## ✅ Recommendations

* **Good fit** for large files, backups, media objects, archives, or content stores.
* **Suboptimal** if your workload involves many small files—consider packing or alternative providers.
* Always **verify deletions**, especially large ones, via the dashboard or API to avoid residual billing.
