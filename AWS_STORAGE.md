Here’s a fresh, up‑to‑date assessment of Amazon S3’s pricing (as of mid‑2025), based on independent research and the official AWS pricing page you linked.

## 🗂️ Storage Costs by Class

**S3 Standard** (frequently accessed data):

* First 50 TB/month: **≈ \$0.023/GB**
* Next 450 TB: **≈ \$0.022/GB**
* Over 500 TB: **≈ \$0.021/GB** ([CloudZero][1])

**S3 Standard – Infrequent Access (Standard‑IA)**:

* ≈ \$0.0125/GB/month. Lower storage cost, but extra retrieval fees apply. ([CloudZero][1])

**S3 One Zone – Infrequent Access (One Zone‑IA)**:

* ≈ \$0.01/GB/month, stored in a single availability zone—less redundancy, lower cost. ([CloudZero][1])

**S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval**:

* ≈ \$0.004/GB/month for immediate retrieval in milliseconds. Ideal for rarely accessed but occasionally needed data. ([CloudZero][1])

**S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval** (formerly classic Glacier):

* ≈ \$0.0036/GB/month; retrieval options range from minutes to hours with additional per‑operation fees. ([en.wikipedia.org][2])

**S3 Glacier Deep Archive**:

* ≈ \$0.00099/GB/month; lowest cost, but retrieval can take up to 12 hours. Best for long‑term archival. ([CloudZero][1])

**S3 Express One Zone** (high‑performance single‑AZ tier introduced recently):

* Storage ≈ \$0.11/GB; request and transfer costs significantly reduced vs Standard tier (\~\$0.00003 per 1 k GET). <!-- storage reduction info from search3 --> ([Cloudchipr][3], [cloudtech.com][4])

**S3 Tables** (Iceberg–native analytic store):

* Around \$0.0265/GB for first 50 TB, \$0.0253 next, \$0.0242 over 500 TB, plus object‑monitoring, compaction and request charges. ([Cloudchipr][3])

## 💸 Extra Cost Components

### Requests & Retrievals

* **PUT, COPY, POST, LIST**: \~ \$0.005 per 1,000 in Standard; slightly higher in IA tiers.
* **GET / SELECT**: \~ \$0.0004 per 1,000 in Standard, \~ \$0.01/1,000 in Standard‑IA.
* Glacier retrievals incur operational fees (e.g., expedited \~\$0.03/GB or bulk \~\$0.0025/GB). ([cloudtech.com][4])

### Data Transfer

* Uploads are free.
* Download (internet): first \~100 GB free, then \$0.09/GB up to \~10 TB; \~ \$0.05/GB above \~150 TB.
* Transfer Acceleration adds \~\$0.04/GB. ([cloudtech.com][4])

### Management & Analytics

* **Storage Lens sensors**: free basic; advanced \~\$0.20/million objects.
* **Inventory, tagging, analytics**: e.g. S3 Analytics \~\$0.10/million objects; Inventory \~\$0.0025/million objects; Tagging \~\$0.0065/10k tags. ([cloudtech.com][4])

### Replication & Lambda-based features

* **Cross/Multi‑region replication**: charges for storage, PUTs and inter‑region data transfer (\~\$0.015/GB for RTC).
* **S3 Object Lambda**: adds AWS Lambda compute (~~\$0.0000167/GB‑sec), request (~~\$0.20/million), and data return (\~\$0.005/GB). ([cloudtech.com][4])

## ✅ Assessment: Strengths & Cost Optimization

### Strengths

* **Flexible storage tiers** allow matching cost to access frequency.
* **Automatic tiering (Intelligent‑Tiering)** minimises manual management—though it adds small monitoring fees (\~\$0.0025 per 1,000 objects). ([Cloudian][5], [Cloudchipr][3])
* **Global durability and availability** with 11‑nines resilience. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][6])

### Considerations

* High volume of small GET/PUT objects can incur notable request costs.
* Features like Storage Lens, analytics, replication, or Object Lambda add to the bill.
* Outbound transfer fees especially for large data exports can accumulate.

### Cost‑saving best practices

* Use **Standard‑IA** or **Glacier tiers** for infrequently accessed data.
* Implement **lifecycle policies** to automatically transition aged data (e.g. move to Glacier after 90 days, then Deep Archive).
* Use **data compression**, manage versions, and delete stale data to reduce volume.
* Consolidate small objects to reduce request overhead.
* Enable **Storage Lens**, analytics to spot optimization opportunities (but track monitoring costs). ([cloudtech.com][4], [Cloudian][5])
