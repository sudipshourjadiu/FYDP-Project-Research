For surveillance video storage, decentralized storage can offer enhanced **privacy**, **resilience**, and potentially **lower long-term costs**‚Äîespecially for infrequently accessed footage with long retention periods. Here are key decentralized options tailored for surveillance use cases:

---

### üß© 1. **Filecoin**

**Best for:** Archival storage with configurable redundancy

* **How it works:** You pay storage providers (miners) to store your encrypted data with verifiable proofs.
* **Retention control:** You set deal durations (30‚Äì540 days or more).
* **Advantages:**

  * Pay-per-duration (ideal for surveillance storage).
  * Deals can be extended or re-sealed.
  * Verifiable storage (proof of replication & space-time).
* **Disadvantages:**

  * Retrieval latency (not instant).
  * Complex setup unless using helper services like [Estuary](https://docs.estuary.tech/) or [Web3.Storage](https://web3.storage/).
* **Pricing (as of 2025):** Typically \~\$0.001‚Äì\$0.005 per GB/month depending on provider and replication factor.

---

### üß© 2. **Arweave**

**Best for:** Permanent, tamper-proof archive storage

* **How it works:** One-time payment for permanent storage using a blockchain-backed endowment.
* **Retention:** Forever (great for legal evidence or compliance).
* **Advantages:**

  * No ongoing fees.
  * Immutable and timestamped.
* **Disadvantages:**

  * High upfront cost (typically \$1‚Äì5 per GB).
  * Not suitable for video footage that doesn‚Äôt need permanence.
* **Pricing:** One-time \~\$4‚Äì\$5/GB (subject to network conditions).

---

### üß© 3. **Storj**

**Best for:** S3-compatible decentralized cloud with CDN-like performance

* **How it works:** Data is encrypted, split, and stored across thousands of nodes.
* **Retention:** Controlled via S3-like API.
* **Advantages:**

  * Faster retrieval compared to Filecoin.
  * Compatible with common tools (e.g., rclone, duplicacy).
  * Pay-as-you-go pricing.
* **Disadvantages:**

  * More centralized than Filecoin (uses node reputation).
* **Pricing (2025):** \~\$0.004/GB/month storage + \$0.007/GB egress.

---

### üß© 4. **IPFS + Pinning Services (e.g., Pinata, Web3.Storage)**

**Best for:** Distribution and linking with other DApps

* **How it works:** Content-addressed storage; pinning ensures persistence.
* **Retention:** Managed by pinning duration or self-hosted nodes.
* **Advantages:**

  * Easily integrates with DApps, blockchain, etc.
  * Good for sharing clips or evidence across systems.
* **Disadvantages:**

  * Requires a pinning service for guaranteed retention.
  * Not ideal for large-scale video unless used with gateways.
* **Pricing:** Varies; Web3.Storage offers 5‚Äì10GB free, \$5+/TB for enterprise.

---

### üîê Security & Privacy Considerations

For **surveillance videos**, always:

* Encrypt footage **before** uploading.
* Use **hash verification** (or storage proofs like in Filecoin).
* Avoid public access unless required (private CID or deal only).

For **surveillance video storage** with a **specific retention period**, **reliable redundancy**, and **low access frequency**, your best fit among decentralized storage options would prioritize:

* ‚úÖ **Redundancy and durability**
* ‚úÖ **Custom retention (e.g., 7, 30, 90, 365 days)**
* ‚úÖ **Low-cost cold/archive tier**
* ‚úÖ **Programmatic access (upload/delete automatically)**
* ‚úÖ **Secure (encrypted at rest)**

Let‚Äôs break down the best suited options:

---

## ‚úÖ **Top 2 Recommendations**

### üîπ **Storj (Cold Archive Tier ‚Äì in Beta)**

* **Best For:** Surveillance or backup storage, infrequently accessed.
* **Custom Retention:** You can program deletion based on your own retention policy (e.g., after 30 or 90 days).
* **Reliability:** Data is erasure-coded and distributed across 80+ global nodes; high durability.
* **Access frequency:** No egress fees if retrieval is infrequent.
* **API Available:** Integrates via S3-compatible API or CLI tools.
* **Encryption:** Default client-side encryption.

**Example Use Case:**

* Upload surveillance videos daily via cron job.
* Set a script to delete old files after retention period.
* Very cost-effective vs AWS S3 Glacier.

---

### üîπ **Filecoin with IPFS (via Web3.Storage or Estuary)**

* **Best For:** Long-term decentralized archival, moderate to large files.
* **Retention:** Can select deals for specific durations (e.g., 30, 180, 365+ days).
* **Low access frequency:** Best if rarely accessed (cold storage).
* **Reliability:** Miners cryptographically prove they‚Äôre storing your data.
* **Access Method:** Deal dashboard or IPFS gateway.

**Consideration:** If you're okay with a ‚Äúset-and-forget‚Äù model and trust the Filecoin market, this can be ideal for retention-based storage.

## üö´ Not Recommended for Your Use Case

| Option              | Why Not Ideal                                             |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Arweave**         | Permanent only (not deletable); costly for video volumes  |
| **BTFS**            | Less mature, less adoption, fewer tools                   |
| **Sia (Skynet/S5)** | Lower adoption, and some host volatility                  |
| **Internxt**        | More like a Dropbox alternative; not ideal for automation |

---

## ‚úÖ Automation Tips

You can use tools like:

* **rclone** or **S3-compatible SDKs** for automated upload/delete
* **CRON Jobs or Node.js scripts** to handle:

  * Uploading daily video files
  * Pruning based on timestamp (retention)

| Platform     | Price (approx.)  | Retention Control | Redundancy    | Notes                       |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Storj**    | \~\$4/TB/month   | ‚úÖ Full control    | ‚úÖ High        | S3-compatible, CLI friendly |
| **Filecoin** | \~\$1‚Äì2/TB/month | ‚úÖ by contract     | ‚úÖ Proof-based | Advanced integration needed |
| **Sia**      | \~\$1‚Äì2/TB/month | ‚úÖ                 | Moderate      | UI & ecosystem weaker       |

---

## üì¶ Suggested Architecture

* **Surveillance devices** upload videos via secure uploader (e.g., rclone, CLI, or custom script).
* Uploads go to **Storj bucket** or **Filecoin deal provider**.
* A **scheduler deletes** videos older than your desired retention period (on Storj).
* Store **hash log or metadata** on IPFS/Filecoin/Arweave if long-term verification needed.
