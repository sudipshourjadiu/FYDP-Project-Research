For surveillance video storage, decentralized storage can offer enhanced **privacy**, **resilience**, and potentially **lower long-term costs**‚Äîespecially for infrequently accessed footage with long retention periods. Here are key decentralized options tailored for surveillance use cases:

---

### üß© 1. **Filecoin**

**Best for:** Archival storage with configurable redundancy

* **How it works:** You pay storage providers (miners) to store your encrypted data with verifiable proofs.
* **Retention control:** You set deal durations (30‚Äì540 days or more).
* **Advantages:**

  * Pay-per-duration (ideal for surveillance storage).
  * Deals can be extended or re-sealed.
  * Verifiable storage (proof of replication & space-time).
* **Disadvantages:**

  * Retrieval latency (not instant).
  * Complex setup unless using helper services like [Estuary](https://docs.estuary.tech/) or [Web3.Storage](https://web3.storage/).
* **Pricing (as of 2025):** Typically \~\$0.001‚Äì\$0.005 per GB/month depending on provider and replication factor.

### üß© 2. **Arweave**

**Best for:** Permanent, tamper-proof archive storage

* **How it works:** One-time payment for permanent storage using a blockchain-backed endowment.
* **Retention:** Forever (great for legal evidence or compliance).
* **Advantages:**

  * No ongoing fees.
  * Immutable and timestamped.
* **Disadvantages:**

  * High upfront cost (typically \$1‚Äì5 per GB).
  * Not suitable for video footage that doesn‚Äôt need permanence.
* **Pricing:** One-time \~\$4‚Äì\$5/GB (subject to network conditions).

### üß© 3. **Storj**

**Best for:** S3-compatible decentralized cloud with CDN-like performance

* **How it works:** Data is encrypted, split, and stored across thousands of nodes.
* **Retention:** Controlled via S3-like API.
* **Advantages:**

  * Faster retrieval compared to Filecoin.
  * Compatible with common tools (e.g., rclone, duplicacy).
  * Pay-as-you-go pricing.
* **Disadvantages:**

  * More centralized than Filecoin (uses node reputation).
* **Pricing (2025):** \~\$0.004/GB/month storage + \$0.007/GB egress.

### üß© 4. **IPFS + Pinning Services (e.g., Pinata, Web3.Storage)**

**Best for:** Distribution and linking with other DApps

* **How it works:** Content-addressed storage; pinning ensures persistence.
* **Retention:** Managed by pinning duration or self-hosted nodes.
* **Advantages:**

  * Easily integrates with DApps, blockchain, etc.
  * Good for sharing clips or evidence across systems.
* **Disadvantages:**

  * Requires a pinning service for guaranteed retention.
  * Not ideal for large-scale video unless used with gateways.
* **Pricing:** Varies; Web3.Storage offers 5‚Äì10GB free, \$5+/TB for enterprise.

### üîê Security & Privacy Considerations

For **surveillance videos**, always:

* Encrypt footage **before** uploading.
* Use **hash verification** (or storage proofs like in Filecoin).
* Avoid public access unless required (private CID or deal only).
