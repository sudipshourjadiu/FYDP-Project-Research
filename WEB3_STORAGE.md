## ðŸ§  What It Means for Your Surveillance Video Use

Web3.Storage offers a **storage plus platform access model**â€”you pay for space and bandwidth, which includes IPFS availability and underlying Filecoin archival deals. However, deal terms like **retention period and actual Filecoin chain costs are abstracted by the service**â€”you donâ€™t set them explicitly.

For a 1â€¯TB monthly incoming video data:

* **Lite plan** isnâ€™t sufficient (only 100â€¯GB).
* **Business plan** fits capacity needs:

  * \$100/month base fee covers up to 2â€¯TB upload.
  * If you store wether more, extra videos cost \$0.03/GB beyond cap.
  * Retrieval costs and storage deals managed by Web3.Storage behind the scenes.
